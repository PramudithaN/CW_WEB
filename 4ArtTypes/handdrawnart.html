        <h1>HandDrawn Art</h1>
        <p>The term "hand-drawn art" describes works of art made on paper, canvas, or other materials utilizing
          traditional media such pencils, charcoal, ink, and paint. The techniques used to make hand-drawn art, which
          can be realistic or abstract, include sketching, shading, cross-hatching, and stippling.

          With a pencil or charcoal, a sketcher creates rough outlines or preliminary drawings of an image.
          This method is frequently used to capture a subject's basic proportions and composition.

          To add depth and complexity to an image, shading is the process of using a pencil or charcoal to vary the tone
          and value. This method can be applied to produce a variety of effects, including light and shadow and fine
          color gradations.

          To add tone and texture to an image, cross-hatching requires arranging crossing lines in a pattern. The
          effects that can be produced with this approach range from bright and graphic to delicate and nuanced.

          Stippling is the process of adding tiny dots or marks to an image to add tone and texture. A variety of
          effects, from smooth and delicate to rough and textured, can be produced with this approach.

          Overall, drawing by hand enables artists to produce distinctive, emotive images that reflect their
          individuality and technique. It frequently requires a high level of expertise and accuracy, and the end
          product can be an image that is intricately detailed with a depth and texture that is rich.</p>
