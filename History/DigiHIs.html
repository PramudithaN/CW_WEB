            <p>
              With the development of computers and other digital technology in the 20th century, a relatively new form of artistic expression known as "digital art" has evolved. From digital painting and drawing to 3D modeling and animation, video game design, and interactive installations, it embraces a wide variety of artistic styles and methods.

              Computer scientists and mathematicians started experimenting with computer-generated graphics and animations in the 1950s, which is when digital art first emerged. Yet it wasn't until the 1980s that digital art really started to catch on as a legitimate art form, thanks to the development of personal computers and graphics programs that made it more affordable for artists.

              When new technology were employed by artists to produce cutting-edge, interactive works, digital art grew in popularity in the 1990s. Net.art, cyberfeminism, and glitch art are some of the most famous digital art movements of this era.

              Today, digital art is still evolving as creators test the limits of technology and look for novel ways to interact with audiences. The future of digital art is bright and exciting with the emergence of virtual and augmented reality, artificial intelligence, and other developing technology.
