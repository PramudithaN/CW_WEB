            <h1>Digital art</h1>
            <p>
                Digital art is a relatively new form of artistic expression that has emerged in the 20th century, with the advent of computers and digital technologies. It encompasses a broad range of artistic styles and techniques, from digital painting and drawing to 3D modeling and animation, video game design, and interactive installations.

                The history of digital art can be traced back to the 1950s, when computer scientists and mathematicians began experimenting with computer-generated images and animations. However, it wasn't until the 1980s that digital art began to gain wider recognition as an art form, with the introduction of personal computers and graphics software that made it more accessible to artists.

                In the 1990s, digital art became increasingly popular, with artists using new technologies to create works that were both innovative and interactive. Some of the most notable digital art movements of this period include net.art, cyberfeminism, and glitch art.

                Today, digital art continues to evolve, with artists pushing the boundaries of what is possible with technology and exploring new ways to engage audiences. With the rise of virtual and augmented reality, artificial intelligence, and other emerging technologies, the future of digital art looks promising and exciting.
