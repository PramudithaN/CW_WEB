              The nearly 17,000-year-old cave paintings of Lascaux, France, are one of the earliest known instances of hand-drawn art. These detailed drawings represent animals and other things and were done using charcoal and natural pigments.

              Hand-drawn art was significant in both religious and secular contexts in ancient Egypt. Intricate carvings and drawings frequently use hieroglyphics, which were used to record significant occasions and stories. These illustrations have given us a window into ancient Egyptian culture and civilization, coupled with the exquisite tomb paintings and sculptures.
