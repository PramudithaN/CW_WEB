      <h1>Ai Art</h1>
      <p>
        Compared to hand-drawn art, the history of AI art is very brief, yet it has advanced significantly in recent
        years. The creation of photographs, sculptures, and other works of art by machine learning algorithms is
        referred to as artificial intelligence (AI) art. Although the first artificial intelligence (AI)-generated works
        of art were produced in the 1960s, the art world didn't start paying much attention to AI art until the 2010s.
        Currently, AI art is displayed in galleries and museums all over the world and is accepted as a valid type of
        art. It's interesting to think of the future creative expressions that AI technology will inspire as it
        develops.
